This project will entail an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an historical price dataset of gold obtained through Kaggle. The data consists of daily gold prices and open, high, low, close, volume and currency values of different years.

This analysis will be carried out to know how the prices of gold have been evolving and to analyze annual and monthly trends. The most significant visualizations comprise time-series graph of closing prices, boxplot by year and month, correlation heatmap to investigate connections of numerical variables.

Pandas process the data and seaborn and matplotlib visualize it. The column called Date is transformed into the datetime format and utilizes values of the year and month to perform trend-based visualization. It also shows the top 10 days when the price of gold is the highest to show major rallies in the market.

This EDA notebook can be valuable to anyone interested in time-series exploration, commodity prices trend, or financial data analysis. It can be used as a basis of additional forecasting models or historical investment analysis of gold behaviour.

In order to execute the notebook, it is recommended to have Python installed and the libraries specified in the requirements.txt file. Then open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or other Python IDE and seek the data and insights.
